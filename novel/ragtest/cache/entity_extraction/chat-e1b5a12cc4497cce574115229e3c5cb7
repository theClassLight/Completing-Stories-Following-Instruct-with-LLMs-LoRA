A pale light, rising in the\nouter air, fell straight upon the bed; and on it, plundered and bereft,\nunwatched, unwept, uncared for, was the body of this man.\n\nScrooge glanced towards the Phantom. Its steady hand was pointed to the\nhead. The cover was so carelessly adjusted that the slightest raising of\nit, the motion of a finger upon Scrooge's part, would have disclosed the\nface. He thought of it, felt how easy it would be to do, and longed to\ndo it; but he had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss the\nspectre at his side.\n\nOh, cold, cold, rigid, dreadful Death, set up thine altar here, and\ndress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy command; for this is thy\ndominion! But of the loved, revered, and honoured head thou canst not\nturn one hair to thy dread purposes, or make one feature odious. It is\nnot that the hand is heavy, and will fall down when released; it is not\nthat the heart and pulse are still; but that the hand was open,\ngenerous, and true; the heart brave, warm, and tender, and the pulse a\nman's. Strike, Shadow, strike! And see his good deeds springing from the\nwound, to sow the world with life immortal!\n\nNo voice pronounced these words in Scrooge's ears, and yet he heard them\nwhen he looked upon the bed. He thought, if this man could be raised up\nnow, what would be his foremost thoughts? Avarice, hard dealing, griping\ncares? They have brought him to a rich end, truly!\n\nHe lay in the dark, empty house, with not a man, a woman, or a child to\nsay he was kind to me in this or that, and for the memory of one kind\nword I will be kind to him. A cat was tearing at the door, and there was\na sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearthstone. What _they_ wanted in\nthe room of death, and why they were so restless and disturbed, Scrooge\ndid not dare to think.\n\n'Spirit!' he said, 'this is a fearful place. In leaving it, I shall not\nleave its lesson, trust me. Let us go!'\n\nStill the Ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the head.\n\n'I understand you,' Scrooge returned, 'and I would do it if I could. But\nI have not the power, Spirit. I have not the power.'\n\nAgain it seemed to look upon him.\n\n'If there is any person in the town who feels emotion caused by this\nman's death,' said Scrooge, quite agonised, 'show that person to me,\nSpirit, I beseech you!'\n\nThe Phantom spread its dark robe before him for a moment, like a wing;\nand, withdrawing it, revealed a room by daylight, where a mother and her\nchildren were.\n\nShe was expecting some one, and with anxious eagerness; for she walked\nup and down the room, started at every sound, looked out from the\nwindow, glanced at the clock, tried, but in vain, to work with her\nneedle, and could hardly bear the voices of her children in their play.\n\nAt length the long-expected knock was heard. She hurried to the door,\nand met her husband; a man whose face was careworn and depressed, though\nhe was young. There was a remarkable expression in it now, a kind of\nserious delight of which he felt ashamed, and which he struggled to\nrepress.\n\nHe sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for him by the fire,\nand when she asked him faintly what news (which was not until after a\nlong silence), he appeared embarrassed how to answer.\n\n'Is it good,' she said, 'or bad?' to help him.\n\n'Bad,' he answered.\n\n'We are quite ruined?'\n\n'No. There is hope yet, Caroline.'\n\n'If _he_ relents,' she said, amazed, 'there is! Nothing is past hope, if\nsuch a miracle has happened.'\n\n'He is past relenting,' said her husband. 'He is dead.'\n\nShe was a mild and patient creature, if her face spoke truth; but she\nwas thankful in her soul to hear it, and she said so with clasped hands.\nShe prayed forgiveness the next moment, and was sorry; but the first was\nthe emotion of her heart.\n\n'What the half-drunken woman, whom I told you of last night, said to me\nwhen I tried to see him and obtain a week's delay--and what I thought\nwas a mere excuse to avoid me--turns out to have been quite true. He was\nnot only very ill, but dying, then.'\n\n'To whom will our debt be transferred?'\n\n'I don't know. But, before that time, we shall be ready with the money;\nand even though we were not, it would be bad fortune indeed to find so\nmerciless a creditor in his successor. We may sleep to-night with light\nhearts, Caroline!'\n\nYes. Soften it as they would, their hearts were lighter. The children's\nfaces, hushed and clustered round to hear what they so little\nunderstood, were brighter; and it was a happier house for this man's\ndeath! The only emotion that the Ghost could\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "qwen2:7b", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
