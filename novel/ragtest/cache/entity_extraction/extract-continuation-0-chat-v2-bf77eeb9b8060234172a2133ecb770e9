'All your other\nhopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its sordid\nreproach. I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until\nthe master passion, Gain, engrosses you. Have I not?'\n\n'What then?' he retorted. 'Even if I have grown so much wiser, what\nthen? I am not changed towards you.'\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n'Am I?'\n\n'Our contract is an old one. It was made when we were both poor, and\ncontent to be so, until, in good season, we could improve our worldly\nfortune by our patient industry. You _are_ changed. When it was made you\nwere another man.'\n\n'I was a boy,' he said impatiently.\n\n'Your own feeling tells you that you were not what you are,' she\nreturned. 'I am. That which promised happiness when we were one in heart\nis fraught with misery now that we are two. How often and how keenly I\nhave thought of this I will not say.

No. Never.'\n\n'In what, then?'\n\n'In a changed nature; in an altered spirit; in another atmosphere of\nlife; another Hope as its great end.

The consequences were uproarious beyond belief; but\nno one seemed to care; on the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed\nheartily, and enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to\nmingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands most\nruthlessly.

And\nyet I should have dearly liked, I own, to have touched her lips; to have\nquestioned her, that she might have opened them; to have looked upon the\nlashes of her downcast eyes, and never raised a blush; to have let loose\nwaves of hair, an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price: in\nshort, I should have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest\nlicense of a child, and yet to have been man enough to know its\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"A Christmas Carol\" by Charles Dickens)\n\n- The text provided is from \"A Christmas Carol,\" written by Charles Dickens.
