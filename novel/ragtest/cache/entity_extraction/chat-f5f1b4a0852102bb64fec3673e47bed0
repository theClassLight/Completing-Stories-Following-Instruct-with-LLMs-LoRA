'I hope they do. \"Heartily\nsorry,\" he said, \"for your good wife. If I can be of service to you in\nany way,\" he said, giving me his card, \"that's where I live. Pray come\nto me.\" Now, it wasn't,' cried Bob, 'for the sake of anything he might\nbe able to do for us, so much as for his kind way, that this was quite\ndelightful. It really seemed as if he had known our Tiny Tim, and felt\nwith us.'\n\n'I'm sure he's a good soul!' said Mrs. Cratchit.\n\n'You would be sure of it, my dear,' returned Bob, 'if you saw and spoke\nto him. I shouldn't be at all surprised--mark what I say!--if he got\nPeter a better situation.'\n\n'Only hear that, Peter,' said Mrs. Cratchit.\n\n'And then,' cried one of the girls, 'Peter will be keeping company with\nsome one, and setting up for himself.'\n\n'Get along with you!' retorted Peter, grinning.\n\n'It's just as likely as not,' said Bob, 'one of these days; though\nthere's plenty of time for that, my dear. But, however and whenever we\npart from one another, I am sure we shall none of us forget poor Tiny\nTim--shall we--or this first parting that there was among us?'\n\n'Never, father!' cried they all.\n\n'And I know,' said Bob, 'I know, my dears, that when we recollect how\npatient and how mild he was; although he was a little, little child; we\nshall not quarrel easily among ourselves, and forget poor Tiny Tim in\ndoing it.'\n\n'No, never, father!' they all cried again.\n\n'I am very happy,' said little Bob, 'I am very happy!'\n\nMrs. Cratchit kissed him, his daughters kissed him, the two young\nCratchits kissed him, and Peter and himself shook hands. Spirit of Tiny\nTim, thy childish essence was from God!\n\n'Spectre,' said Scrooge, 'something informs me that our parting moment\nis at hand. I know it but I know not how. Tell me what man that was whom\nwe saw lying dead?'\n\nThe Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come conveyed him, as before--though at a\ndifferent time, he thought: indeed there seemed no order in these latter\nvisions, save that they were in the Future--into the resorts of business\nmen, but showed him not himself. Indeed, the Spirit did not stay for\nanything, but went straight on, as to the end just now desired, until\nbesought by Scrooge to tarry for a moment.\n\n'This court,' said Scrooge, 'through which we hurry now, is where my\nplace of occupation is, and has been for a length of time. I see the\nhouse. Let me behold what I shall be in days to come.'\n\nThe Spirit stopped; the hand was pointed elsewhere.\n\n'The house is yonder,' Scrooge exclaimed. 'Why do you point away?'\n\nThe inexorable finger underwent no change.\n\nScrooge hastened to the window of his office, and looked in. It was an\noffice still, but not his. The furniture was not the same, and the\nfigure in the chair was not himself. The Phantom pointed as before.\n\nHe joined it once again, and, wondering why and whither he had gone,\naccompanied it until they reached an iron gate. He paused to look round\nbefore entering.\n\nA churchyard. Here, then, the wretched man, whose name he had now to\nlearn, lay underneath the ground. It was a worthy place. Walled in by\nhouses; overrun by grass and weeds, the growth of vegetation's death,\nnot life; choked up with too much burying; fat with repleted appetite. A\nworthy place!\n\nThe Spirit stood among the graves, and pointed down to One. He advanced\ntowards it trembling. The Phantom was exactly as it had been, but he\ndreaded that he saw new meaning in its solemn shape.\n\n'Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point,' said Scrooge,\n'answer me one question. Are these the shadows of the things that Will\nbe, or are they shadows of the things that May be only?'\n\nStill the Ghost pointed downward to the grave by which it stood.\n\n'Men's courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if persevered in,\nthey must lead,' said Scrooge. 'But if the courses be departed from, the\nends will change. Say it is thus with what you show me!'\n\nThe Spirit was immovable as ever.\n\nScrooge crept towards it, trembling as he went; and, following the\nfinger, read upon the stone of the neglected grave his own name,\nEBENEZER SCROOGE.\n\n'Am I that man who lay upon the bed?' he cried upon his knees.\n\nThe finger pointed from the grave to him, and back again.\n\n'No, Spirit! Oh no, no!'\n\nThe finger still was there.\n\n'Spirit!' he cried, tight clutching at its robe, 'hear me! I am not the\nman I was. I will not be the man I must have been but for this\nintercourse. Why show me this, if I am past all hope?'\n\nFor the first time the hand appeared to shake.\n\n'Good\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "qwen2:7b", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
